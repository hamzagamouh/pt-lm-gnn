# Utilizing Protein Language Models combined with Graph Neural Networks for Protein-Ligand Binding Sites detection

This is the code repository for our work "Utilizing Protein Language Models combined with Graph Neural Networks for Protein-Ligand Binding Sites detection".


## Environment setup
To run the scripts, please install the Conda environement by following these steps :
1. Create a Conda environment `conda create --name plm-gnn`
2. Activate the environment `conda activate plm-gnn`
3. If you have GPUs install pytorch for CUDA --> `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 cuda -c pytorch -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.1"`
4. Install other pip requirements --> `pip install requirements.txt`
## Datasets
